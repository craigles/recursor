        <meta name="description" content="Electronic based compositions. Through the Arched Window is a high energy, densely melodic, kaleidoscopic thrill ride. The track is inspired by the frenetic drum programming of early Squarepusher; lo-fi video game soundtracks and the dreamlike atmosphere of the Australian children's TV show Play School. Most of the track was composed using a Teenage Engineering OP-1 synth and a Tascam multitrack recorder. Mercedes Bralo on classical harp adds an ethereal, dreamy quality to this hard hitting electronica track.">
